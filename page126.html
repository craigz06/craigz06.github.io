I think Messinger married into the family? From what I see on our family tree, Ilona Hana (Eleanor) Messinger (Mezei) born 1889, married your grandmother Manci's brother Arpad Klein. As you probably know, there were three Klein Brothers, Manci was the daughter of one of the brothers (pretty sure the name was Moshe), your grandfather Sandor and my grandfather Arnold (my mom's father) were Adolph's sons. It's a little confusing, there may have been some Mezei related name changes? I believe some of my research showed your grandmother using the name Mezei/Messinger at some point. My mother actually remembers many stories including about your grandparents getting together. My mom has an incredible memory, she stayed with us at the beginning of Covid and it gave me an opportunity to ask her a lot of questions. Apparently your grandfather went to Budapest from Acs for medical school and stayed with his uncle (Manci's father). That is when he got to know your grandmother better. Your grandfather lived in Budapest and the other two brothers were in Acs, which is close to Gyor where I was born. If you an invite to view our family tree, let me know. I think it's your daughter who also has an ancestry.com tree? I think she came up as a 23andme match to me and my mom - Stephanie? Take care and stay safe!</p><p><br></p><p>
