In 1946, the paths of the Cline and Claus families intertwined in a romantic saga when Steven Cline, a distinguished doctor and Captain in the US Army during the gripping times of World War II, exchanged vows with Gloria Claus. Their love story, which blossomed in the historical backdrop of Buffalo, New York, marked the beginning of a new lineage. The couple welcomed a new chapter in their lives with the birth of their son, Craig Cline, in 1948. Embracing change and new opportunities, they relocated to Atlanta in 1954, setting the stage for the next act of their family's journey.</p>

Elizabeth Ward's journey is a tapestry of determination and serendipity, beginning in the bustling borough of Queens, New York, where she was born in 1953. In the cozy confines of a one-bedroom garden apartment, she grew up alongside her sister Jackie, cultivating dreams that reached far beyond their humble abode. Elizabeth's pursuit of education led her to the prestigious NYC School of Design, where she blended her artistic flair with academic rigor. Juggling work and studies, she emerged triumphant with a Ph.D. in Epidemiology, a testament to her resilience and dedication.

Destiny then guided Elizabeth to Atlanta, where she joined the American Cancer Society, dedicating her expertise to a noble cause. It was there that fate introduced her to Craig, then Vice President of Pacific International Hardwoods. Both Elizabeth and Craig, having navigated the turbulent waters of difficult divorces, found solace and understanding in each other, their paths merging through the thoughtful orchestration of a matchmaker.

Together, they embarked on a new chapter in 2014, relocating to the vibrant community of Asheville. Here, they channeled their combined talents into the realm of real estate development, transforming spaces and lives, much like they transformed their own. Their partnership not only rejuvenates landscapes but also symbolizes a journey of hope, resilience, and renewed beginnings.
