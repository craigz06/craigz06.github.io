            <div class="mbr-article mbr-article--wysiwyg col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><p><br></p><p>October 5, 2021</p><p><br></p><p>My District 1 Commissioners,</p><p>Having now read the Answer Man September 18, 2020 column concerning the danger of using the boat landing at Hominy Creek River and Picnic Park I would like to relate what happened there one year later to my wife and myself on September 25, 2021:</p><p>Following the advice of Romanticasheville.com we decided to try out the French Broad River Paddle Trail on a section known as the “Biltmore Run.” Following their advice, we put out at the Hominy Creek River Park Access Point. As my wife stepped out of our two-man kayak onto the bottom of the park stairs she lost her footing, and was quickly submerged down the steep and deep underwater bank and into the river. The unsheltered current at this landing is very strong, and the surrounding water is over her head.</p><p>A few feet from the stairs a newly fallen tree projected from the bank, aggravating the rapid current that was dragging her quickly away from the bank. Grabbing the kayak’s lead line, I jumped in to rescue her and quickly found myself over my head too. Luckily, we were both wearing life jackets and managed to grab on to the tree, with me trying to hold on to the log with one hand and the boat with the other, against the strong current pulling us out to the middle of the river. Soon I was completely exhausted and having difficulty breathing. Thankfully, we eventually were able to climb on top of the large fallen tree trunk and make it back to shore with our boat.&nbsp;</p><p>This access point is dangerous, a public menace that has no cautionary sign, no handrail nor cleat to tie onto. The grade is so steep that there is no place to stand while disembarking. Clearly there are design flaws with this Access Point. At the bottom of the stairs, just below the waterline, there is no rip rap, gravel nor platform to support egress or ingress. Additionally, there is no handrail for the steep stairs as required by code. The tree protruding parallel to the riverbank is making the swift current worse.</p><p>The need for these design changes can be seen in the new design of the Carrier Park River Access Point seen in the picture above.</p><p>My wife and I were very lucky that there was a tree branch under the log that enabled us to have stable support to climb on the log, and we escaped relatively unharmed. However, we recognized that we came very close to being stranded clinging to the log until someone came by who could help.  Although we realize that our lack of experience contributed to the accident, it should not be assumed that all members of the public who use the landing are experienced boaters or wearing life jackets.  Thus, we think there is a potential for serious injury, or even drowning, for others who might lose their footing on the hazardous landing. We therefore contacted a number of individuals and organizations who might be able to remedy the situation.</p><p>On September 26th I called Peyton O’Conner of the Recreation Services Administrative Office. Payton said the area was recently hit by a flood, and (s)he was not aware of the fallen tree. (S)he stated they are currently understaffed by one half, and under-financed to handle problems and suggested I contact my commissioner(s). They also said the stairs have been like this for thirty years and did not see any way it could change. They mentioned there have been many complaints about the site but not to expect any improvements unless further funding could be found. I told them it was not only the steepness of the stairs that were a problem, but the depth of the water next to stairs and strong current, a lack of warning, signage, a handrail, a post to secure the boat to or a stable platform</p><p>I also contacted  Riverlink’s new Executive Director, Dr. Lisa Raleigh. She promised to review the existing conditions of the various access points. But a few hours later she had spoken to her assistant and said that Riverlink was more into the environmental quality of the French Broad and that I should contact Hartwell Carlson, the Riverkeeper because the access Points fall within his domain. When I spoke with him, he said that he had used the point hundreds of times with no problem, though he was not aware of the fallen tree. I felt he was dismissive of the safety concerns of a couple of old people falling in the water for a ‘swim’.</p><p>I am aware of the Buncombe Municipal Code, Chapter 10, Building and Building Regulations, Section g.</p><p><em>Protective railings. Every porch, terrace or entrance platform 30 inches above adjacent finish grade shall be equipped with railings or guards not less than 36 inches high. Handrails, continuous on all open sides of stairs exceeding four risers, leading to a platform, porch or terrace, shall be installed at least 30 inches high.</em></p><p>There should be no exception for a set of very steep public stairs that may not meet riser and tread dimensions, and have no handrail that transverse from water to land. After speaking with Amanda from the  US Corp of Engineers, I learned that permits are already in place for remediation work that might include rip rap at the bottom of the stairs, new handrails, a wider platform  or other stair work not disturbing more than the bottom of the stairs. She said application for additional permits would not be necessary.</p><p>So, I ask does this non-conforming boat launching/landing construe an example of Negligence by Buncombe County? From my perspective, the existing design  is the result of the County not following a duty of conduct imposed by law. Not abiding by building regulations and common sense in regard to old access points while still building lawful new Access Points seems to be evidence of fact. One might argue my wife and I were poor rafters, and the County is harmless but past complaints, a visual inspection and our incident speaks otherwise. The County cannot fail to act based on economic hardship when the duty to preserve life may be a simple and low-cost matter of signage, handrail and riprap.&nbsp;</p><p>As to the lack of county funds to upgrade this public landing, I wonder why the proceeds of the hotel tax cannot be used to inspect and upgrade as needed all the local boat access points on the French Broad since the river is a major draw for tourists.  At the very least, public information about the access points should warn that some may be hazardous to inexperienced boaters (It was after our accident we learned that there was a much safer landing point just a few minutes downriver at Carrier Park).  The county should not wait for a hapless resident or tourist to be severely injured or drowned to remedy this dangerous situation.</p><p>Craig Cline<br></p><p>Rosemary Cottage</p><p>10 Sunset Terrace</p><p>Asheville, NC  28801</p></div>
